Compiling and running all of the sample programs is explained in the
text of the "Definitive Guide to GCC, 2nd Edition". Only complete
programs used as examples are provided here - no code snippets.

The directory Chapter07/examples contains the sample configure.ac and 
Makefile.am whose construction is described in that Chapter, but I
suggest that you construct them yourself as describe in the chapter to
familiarize yourself with autoconf and automake.
